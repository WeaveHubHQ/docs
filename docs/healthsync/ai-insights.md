# HealthSync: AI Insights

Automated summaries of your Apple Health data across sleep, activity, and heart metrics. Runs on your schedule or on-demand and stays in-app with notifications plus a non-medical disclaimer.

## Configure

1. In HealthSync, go to **Integrations → AI Insights → Configure**.
2. Pick cadence: **Daily** or **Weekly**.
3. Pick trigger: **Manual only** (tap when you want a summary) or **Automatic** (runs once per day).
4. Save. If Automatic is enabled you’ll get in-app notifications when summaries are ready.

## Notes

- Manual trigger runs immediately; daily runs queue once every 24h.
- Summaries are not shared with third parties. Each summary includes a non-medical disclaimer.
